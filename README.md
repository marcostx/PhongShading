# Phong Ilumination (without opacity)

In this work we implemented a simple model called Phong lighting model. Here, we consider only opaque objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is built using the functions of the IFT library. Here we use the compiled lib for Mac. GCC and CMake are the most important prerequisites for this project.


### Compiling


```
make Phong
```


## Running
```
./Phong input.csn
            input-label.scn
            output-image.png
            tilt
            spin
```

where output-image.png is the output file, which will be generated at the end of the program in the data folder, tilt and spin are the angles for projection.
